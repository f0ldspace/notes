# How to Outperform

- Simple Habits with Massive Returns

---

# The Secret

**Low Cost + High Return = Outperformance**

- **No complex systems**
- **No guru nonsense**
- **Just what actually works**

---

# Habit #1: Solution Reflection

- How to Get Solutions Faster

**After solving ANY problem:**

1. Review your thought process
2. Ask: "How did I solve this?"
3. Ask: "How could I have done it better?"

**Most people never do this**

## The Compound Effect

**Day 1:** Solve slowly
**Day 100:** Solve faster
**Day 1000:** Solve instantly

**Because you actually learned from each one**

---

# Habit #2: Ego Death

- If Someone's Better, Just Listen

**The Problem:**
"But it won't feel like MY accomplishment"

**The Reality:**
Success > Your feelings

---

## The Expert Shortcut

- Why Reinvent the Wheel?

**Expert:** "Do X, Y, and Z"
**You:** "Okay" ‚Üí Success in 1 year
**VS**
**You:** "I'll figure it out myself" ‚Üí Success in 5 years (maybe)

---

# Habit #3: Accept Simple Solutions

- The Uncomfortable Truth

**Most problems have simple solutions**

You just don't want to accept them

---

## Weight Loss Example

- The "Complex" Solution:
  Count calories + Maintain deficit = Lose weight
  **That's literally it**
  Apps do the work for you
  Instead people waste time looking for keto or other worthless trash

---

## The Psychology

- Why We Reject Simple Solutions:

"This destroyed my life for YEARS..."
"...and the solution was THIS EASY?"
"...everyone told me this from day one?"

**Yes. Accept it. Move on.**

---

# Habit #4: Prediction Logging

- Calibrate Your Confidence

**The System:**

1. Make prediction
2. Log confidence (55%, 65%, 75%, 85%, 95%)
3. Track results
4. Adjust

---

## Confidence Calibration

- After 100 Predictions:
  **At 75% confidence:**

- 75 correct = Perfect calibration ‚úÖ
- 90 correct = Underconfident üìâ
- 60 correct = Overconfident üìà

**Most people are wildly overconfident**

---

# Habit #5: Work Harder

## The Unpopular Truth

**Working harder almost always helps**

More than you think
More than Reddit says
More than feels comfortable

---

## The Burnout Myth

- Burnout happens when:

‚ùå Poor sleep
‚ùå Bad diet  
‚ùå No exercise
‚ùå High stress

**NOT from working hard with basics covered**

---

## Work Capacity Reality

- Most People: "40 hours is plenty!"

**Reality Check:**

- 40 ‚Üí 60 hours = Massive gains
- 60 ‚Üí 80 hours = Still significant
- 80 ‚Üí 100 hours = Diminishing but positive

**Try it before dismissing it**

---

# Habit #6: Basic Stuff First

- Before You Try Biohacking:

‚úÖ Sleep 7-9 hours
‚úÖ Exercise regularly
‚úÖ No recreational drugs
‚úÖ No alcohol
‚úÖ Decent diet

**THEN consider supplements**

---

## Effect Sizes Matter

- What Actually Moves the Needle:

**Large Effect:**

- Sleep (+30% performance)
- Exercise (+25% mood/energy)
- No alcohol (+20% clarity)

**Small Effect:**

- Nootropics (+5% maybe?)

---

## The Hierarchy

- Order of Operations:

1. **Fix sleep** (biggest ROI)
2. **Add exercise** (second biggest)
3. **Remove drugs/alcohol**
4. **Improve diet**
5. **Work harder**
6. Everything else

---

# The Competition

What Everyone Else Does:

- "Work smarter not harder" ‚ùå
- Chase hacks before basics ‚ùå

**This is why outperforming is easy**

---

# Remember
