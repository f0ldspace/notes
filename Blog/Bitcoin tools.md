#Crypto/Bitcoin 
This will be a list of tools that I think are useful. Just because I think somethings useful does not mean I have a use for it, I use anything in bold.

- **[Nostr](https://njump.me/)**: a protocol that mainly functions as decentralised social media with integrated bitcoin, censorship resistant
- **[Oracolo](https://github.com/dtonon/oracolo)**: Setup a blog that automatically loads your blog psots from nostr into a self contained html file
- **[Anonstr](https://anonostr.com/)**: anonymously post on nostr from a burner account, scream into the void
- **[Yakihonne](https://yakihonne.com/)**: In my view the best nostr client right now, great mobile app, allows you to make blog posts (articles) and has encrypted messaging (though encrypted messaging on nostr has flaws)
- **[Primal](https://primal.net/)**: A good beginner friendly nostr platform with a built in bitcoin wallet
