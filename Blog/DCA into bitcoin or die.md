#Crypto/Bitcoin 

A lot of people talk about how bitcoin has averaged 60% yearly but I personally find this to be misleading so I thought I'd use historic prices and portfolioperformance to see if you DCA (or in this case did a weekly purchase) starting at jan 1st of each year ending dec 31st

| Year | % Change |  
|------|----------|  
| 2024 | +124%    |  
| 2023 | +140%    |  
| 2022 | -60%     |  
| 2021 | +60%     |  
| 2020 | +267%    |  
| 2019 | +71%     |  
| 2018 | -67%     |  
| 2017 | +588%    |  
| 2016 | +38%     |  
| 2015 | +7%      |  
  
If you showed this to any investor at any hedge fund they wouldn't believe it, yet this is something that through DCA apps like strike is performance anyone can get through just setting it and forgetting it.
