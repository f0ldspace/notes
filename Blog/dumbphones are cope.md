Theres a popular trend among people who never grew up with old tech to suddenly embrace it as rebellion against enshitification and capitalism but as someone who actually grew up with old phones and old tech theres a reason why iphones and social media won, because they're better.

This doesn't mean they don't have flaws, it means that even with the flaws they still outperform; dumbphones are a bandaid but smartphones have comprehensive features built in that work more like a bandage - ironically the solution smart phones have to the problem of smartphones is _still_ better than using a dumbphone as a solution to smartphones - parental control and screen time features work and they're incredibly robust, if you set them up in a well thought out way you can get an insane amount of utility from your smartphone and **none** of the downsides, if you have a friend setup the parental features according to your wishes it can be setup in such a way that you as the owner of the device cannot get around it, limiting how long you can spend on social media, limiting what apps you can install, what websites you can go on but without losing any of the insane value of smartphones such as

- signal: private communications
- camera: not needing to carry a camera
- ability to send photos quickly and easily to friends
- ability to share what your doing with others publicly
- ability to pay for things without needing to carry a card
- uber
- bus/train apps
- note taking apps that're searchable and instantly backed up
- maps app
- weather app

These are just some of the things on my phone that provide high value, think about how much clutter I would have to carry if I switched to a dumbphone and not only that, the cluttered separate items would perform worse and cost more (since I already own a smartphone).

I'm not saying dumbphones are useless but they solve nothing, setting up a smartphone to remove risk and harm whilst maximising value forces you to give careful consideration to the problem 

- Can I trust myself to not turn this off?
-  How much time do I want to spend on instagram?
- Do I want notifications on for this person?
- Do I _ever_ want notifications from twitter?
- What value does my phone even provide?

Now you might say you asked those questions before switching to a dumbphone but my point is it's optional, you can not think about any of those things and switch to a dumbphone whereas in something approximating irony when doing it on a smartphone you _have_ to be intentional, mindful, honest and self aware. You have to give serious thought to can you control yourself or self limit certain behaviours and if not would moderation or complete abstinence be better?

In my case I struggle with instagram, but I didn't want to get rid of it because it's how I keep in touch with some friends and keep up to date on their life and them on mine, it also is a good point of contact for new people I meet or people who want to get in touch - but if I average this out i.e messaging (occasional) , posting and looking at friends posts it should only really take me maybe 10 minutes per day maximum - I set a ten minute lock, what happens if I spend 10 minutes scrolling reels and then want to post something? I can't, I'm punished for the behaviour which discourages me from doing it next time.

dumbphones feel like a punishment for a problem you haven't tried to fix and for a behaviour you can't clearly articulate - you know you're doing something wrong and might be able to name the action (wasting time on tiktok) but you have no actual understanding of the behaviour (i.e why you do it or why it's even bad beyond some vague harm you ironically heard on tiktok).

you're spending money for no additional value beyond social value (wow a flip phone how quirky) and I've yet to meet a single logn term dumbphone user with an active social life - ironically I do know a person who makes tiktoks about living with a dumbphone - they film the tiktoks on an iphone they take with them everwhere and use as their daily phone. I'm not saying all dumbphone influencers are lying but I'm skeptical someone whos embraced the dumbphone would spend their free time making tiktoks or online content at all really, maybe they would at the start but long term? I doubt it.

smartphones have tons of apps and all those apps have shitty subscription services and each update makes the app worse but there is still untapped value to be found in them - look at it as a tool that exists to perform functions and it'll make your life a lot better. You have to be mindful and intentional with technology or it will just do whatever large corporations want it to do.
