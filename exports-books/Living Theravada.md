- Cambodia’s Khmer Rouge, in power between 1970 and 1975, persecuted much of Buddhism in the country, destroying monasteries and forcibly disrobing monks. Similarly, the communist government in Laos, the Pathet Lao, began by using the unity and power of Buddhism, but by 1975 it had created a secular communist regime, where monks were encouraged to disrobe and earn their own livelihoods

- Since Theravada Buddhists use Pali instead of Sanskrit, the terms in this book will be in Pali, unless otherwise specified. I will refer to kamma and nibbana instead of the more familiar Sanskrit terms karma and nirvana

- In contrast to humans, animals do not have the capacity to pursue the religious path as their lives are filled with suffering and focus on survival. Demons, also known as hungry ghosts, traditionally are depicted as afflicted with greed but are never able to satisfy their desires. Hell beings are tortured in response to their bad kamma. These beings must exhaust the bad kamma that caused rebirth there and then they can be reborn in any of the realms, depending on which kammic seeds come to fruition next.

- Kamma is often depicted in English-language popular culture as an instant kind of revenge. However, kamma in Theravada Buddhism is a long game. Most frequently, a Theravada Buddhist will attribute positive or negative circumstances in their current life to their immediate past life and will endeavor to create good kamma in this life to be reborn in one of the fortunate realms

- Although meditation is not the primary Buddhist activity for most monks and laypeople, it is a crucial part of the Eightfold Path leading to nibbana. As one progresses on the path, the three components of morality, concentration, and wisdom mutually reinforce one another and continually develop. Morality provides the framework for a contemplative life, while mindfulness, concentration, and insight meditation practice create purity of mind.
