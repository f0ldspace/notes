- Dzesé’s parents gave me new clothing and boots and said, “When riches are gone, you needn’t think yourself poor, since they are like dew drops in a meadow. In the past, your ancestors didn’t acquire wealth until later on in life. For you, too, a time of prosperity will come.” Saying this they consoled us over and over.

- “But since it is a mistake to practice the Lower Vehicle seeking happiness and peace for oneself, through the desire to free all sentient beings from life’s round in its entirety, one generates the mind set on enlightenment. With love and compassion, everything one does is dedicated to the benefit of others—this, I have understood, is arousing the attitude of enlightenment according to the Great Vehicle.

- “You don’t need them for yourself?” she asked.
“I practice austerities and seek food as do birds and mice, so I have no need for fields. I dwell in caves in uninhabited places, so I have no need for a house. Even if I were a master of the entire world, I would still need to leave them aside at the time of death. So if I renounce these things now, I shall find happiness in this and all future lives. Doing so, my conduct is contrary to that of all other men, so you can say I am no longer a man.”
