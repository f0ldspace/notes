## Spellcasting
Spellcasting is a term i use for a certain mindset that seems to believe in magic, that a certain combination of words can turn a non-productive person into a productive one. I do not believe this can happen, it can make productive people more productive but that's it. A truly non-productive person will have that trait so embedded in who they are that it cannot be changed by seeing a certain number of words in a certain order.

## Low Variance

- **Friction Kills**
- **Exercise**
- **Sleep**
- **Caffeine**
## Models
- **if someones better do what they tell you** - I've noticed a lot of people won't take advice from people who knows better (I think because they feel if they just do what they're told it doesn't feel like 'their' accomplishment), If someone is more credible than you and the advice they give is credible just do what you're told
- **working harder is almost always beneficial** - Despite the doomerish advice hard work and time spent working is beneficial way more than most people give it credit for, there's probably a point at which it tops off (16hrs a day might be marginally better than 12hrs) but it's way higher than you'd instinctively expect
- **basic stuff works very well** - Certain basic advice (sleep, exercise, don't take recreational drugs, don't drink) are not only incredibly consistent but they also have very large effect sizes, do the basic stuff before moving onto the more esoteric like nicotine patches or adderall
## Habits
- **how to get the solution faster** - As a habit each time you solve a problem go over your actual thought process, how did you solve it? After you've looked critically at it ask how you could have improved it
- **accept easy/simple solutions** - Weight loss is incredibly simple, you weigh yourself daily, count your calories and maintain a deficit of 200-500kcal daily, apps automate most of the heavy lifting, As a human it's natural to fight against simple/easy solutions to longstanding problems; "Not only has this thing been destroying my life for years but the solution is easy and something everyone already knows? the solution is the thing everyones been telling me since the problem first started?"
- **log predictions** - Keep a log of your predictions (I use apple numbers) then also log your confidence (55%, 65%, 75%, 85%, 95%) in each prediction and see how close you are, If you make 100 predictions at 55% confidence only 55 of them should be correct, if more are correct you're under confident if less are correct you're overconfident
