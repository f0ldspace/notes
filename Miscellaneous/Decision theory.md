Decision theory is a framework for understanding how rational agents make choices under various conditions of uncertainty, risk, and conflicting values. It combines elements of philosophy, economics, psychology, and mathematics to analyze decision-making processes.

## Core Components of Decision Theory
Decision theory generally divides into two main branches:
1. **Normative Decision Theory**: Focuses on how rational agents _should_ make decisions, providing principles for optimal decision-making.
2. **Descriptive Decision Theory**: Examines how people _actually_ make decisions in practice, acknowledging cognitive biases and limitations.

## Key Concepts in Decision Theory
### Expected Utility Theory
At the heart of classical decision theory is expected utility theory, which suggests that rational agents should choose actions that maximize their expected utility (subjective value or satisfaction). This involves:
- Assigning probabilities to possible outcomes
- Assigning utilities to those outcomes
- Calculating expected utility by multiplying probabilities and utilities
- Selecting the option with highest expected utility
### Decision Rules
Different rules guide decision-making under uncertainty:
- **Maximin**: Choose the option whose worst possible outcome is best
- **Maximax**: Choose the option whose best possible outcome is best
- **Minimax Regret**: Choose the option that minimizes maximum possible regret
- **Principle of Insufficient Reason**: Treat all unknown probabilities as equal

### Challenges to Classical Decision Theory
Several phenomena challenge standard expected utility theory:
- **Allais Paradox**: Shows how people violate the independence axiom of expected utility theory
- **Ellsberg Paradox**: Demonstrates aversion to ambiguity beyond risk aversion
- **Prospect Theory**: Accounts for asymmetric valuation of gains versus losses
- **Bounded Rationality**: Recognizes cognitive limitations in decision-making

## Applications
Decision theory finds applications in:
- Economics and game theory
- Public policy and governance
- Artificial intelligence and machine learning
- Business strategy and management
- Medical decision-making
- Ethics and philosophy

## Modern Developments
Contemporary decision theory has expanded to include:
- **Evidential Decision Theory**: Considers actions as evidence about decision outcomes
- **Causal Decision Theory**: Focuses on causal relationships between actions and outcomes
- **Updateless Decision Theory**: Considers decisions from a timeless perspective without privileging current knowledge
