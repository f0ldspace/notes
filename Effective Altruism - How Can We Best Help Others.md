- Two meanings of the term “effective altruism” are worth distinguishing: effective altruism as the ideal of helping others as much as possible, and effective altruism as a social movement consisting of people who are trying to live up to this ideal

- There are two core elements to effective altruism. First, there is the altruism itself. This is not altruism in the irresponsible sense of sacrificing for others without any regard for oneself, but rather in the simple sense of improving the lives of others — something that requires us to take good care of ourselves indeed. This may be considered the emotional part of effective altruism, the burning flame at the center that animates the project. Second, there is the effectiveness. This is the cooler, more cerebral aspect that asks us to optimize our core goal: helping other sentient beings is great, but helping them as much as our resources allow is even greater.

- We are all in that situation of the person passing the shallow pond: we can all save lives of people, both children and adults, who would otherwise die, and we can do so at a very small cost to us: the cost of a new CD, a shirt or a night out at a restaurant or concert, can mean the difference between life and death to more than one person somewhere in the world — and overseas aid agencies like Oxfam overcome the problem of acting at a distance

- It should be noted that the specifics of this thought experiment have been criticized by many, including some self-identified effective altruists. For instance, the price of saving a human life does not seem comparable to that of a CD, but appears to instead be in the thousands of dollars

- A preliminary question worth clarifying is whether effective altruism is just a rebranding of utilitarianism, the ethical theory that requires us to bring about the greatest wellbeing — or the least illbeing — for sentient beings. The short answer to this question is “no”. For although utilitarianism implies that we should be effective altruists, at least of some kind, the arrow does not point the other way. That is, one can be an effective altruist without being a utilitarian

- as psychologist Paul Slovic has shown, not only does our empathy not increase as the magnitude of a disaster grows, but it actually seems to decrease rapidly.

- The final virtue of effective altruism I shall review here is expected value thinking. Such thinking reflects the insufficiency of evaluating which possible outcomes to aim for merely in terms of the probability or the value of these outcomes. We have to factor in both: the estimated probability of bringing about a given outcome multiplied by its estimated value. This is the expected value of trying to realize this given outcome.
  To take a concrete example involving two betting options: say for option A we have a 50 percent probability of winning a prize of 10,000 dollars, which means that option A has an expected value of 0.5 times 10,000 dollars (= 5,000 dollars), while option B gives us a one percent chance of winning a prize of a million dollars, which yields an expected value of 0.01 times 1,000,000 dollars (= 10,000 dollars). So although the probability of winning the prize is much smaller with option B, we should still bet on that over option A on the expected value framework (assuming that our aim is to win the greatest amount of money).

- Scale, or scope, refers to the size of the problem. There is no unique measure for evaluating scale, but it could, for example, be in terms of how many individuals it affects, or how intense it is (e.g. intense suffering can reasonably be said to have great magnitude even if it only affects relatively few individuals). Tractability, sometimes called solvability, refers to how amenable to solution the problem is. That is, how much of the problem do we expect to solve per resource we spend on it? Finally, neglectedness is how overlooked the problem is by other people. This last consideration is relevant because a neglected problem will be more likely to have low-hanging fruits ready to be picked compared to a problem that many people are working on

- The organization GiveWell evaluates charities that help humans in the developing world in order to find out which of these charities achieve the most per dollar donated. GiveWell cites two reasons for this focus on people in the developing world: 1) poor people in richer countries are “wealthy by developing-world standards”, and 2) probably for this first reason, GiveWell has found no poverty-targeting interventions in richer countries that compare favorably to its most recommended interventions in the developing world.[23]

- In a world where more than five million children under the age of five die every year, and where more than half of these deaths “are due to conditions that could be prevented or treated with access to simple, affordable interventions”, it is difficult to defend not doing something.[25] And upon deciding to do something, it seems difficult to defend not examining how we can do the best something

- So where do we begin if we are to gain clarity about our values? An obvious place to start might be to consider different theories of ethics. Three prominent classes of such theories are virtue ethics (roughly: we should be virtuous), deontological ethics (roughly: we should act according to certain duties), and consequentialist ethics (roughly: we should bring about the best consequences).

- Most self-identified effective altruists lean toward consequentialism. Yet even if we were to declare ourselves pure consequentialists, we would still have a long way to go toward specifying our values, as we would then still need to clarify what kinds of consequences, or states of the world, that are of greater value than others. We may do this by saying that we are consequentialists of a utilitarian flavor. Yet this is just a small step toward greater specification, as there are also many different kinds of utilitarianism, and they can differ quite radically from each other in what they hold to be valuable, and hence also in terms of their practical implications.

- The values that I find most plausible fall within a broader class of ethical views called suffering-focused ethics, which encompasses all views that give special priority to the alleviation and prevention of suffering. In this chapter, I will review some general arguments and considerations in favor of such views.
  It should be noted, however, that not all effective altruists agree with this view of values. Many appear to view the creation of happiness as having the same importance as the reduction of “equal” suffering

- Author Lukas Gloor defends a view he calls tranquilism, which holds that the value of happiness lies in its absence of suffering.[51] Thus, according to tranquilism, states of euphoric bliss are not of greater value than, say, states of peaceful contentment free of any negative components.

- To many of us, this is a highly counterintuitive view, at least at first sight. After all, do we not seek pleasure almost all the time, often at the seemingly justified cost of suffering? Yet one can frame this seeking in another way that is consistent with tranquilism, by viewing our search for pleasure as really being an attempt to escape suffering and dissatisfaction. On this framing, what appears to be a transition from neutral to positive is really a transition from a state of negativity, however subtle, to a state that is relieved, at least to some extent, from this negativity

- in his book The Battle for Compassion: Ethics in an Apathetic Universe, Jonathan Leighton argues for a pragmatic position he calls “negative utilitarianism plus”, according to which we should aim to do our best to reduce preventable suffering, yet where we can still “categorically refuse to intentionally destroy the planet and eliminate ourselves and everything we care about in the process”

- A similar report was given by journalist Jacobo Timerman, who was captured and tortured by the Argentine military regime of the late 1970s:
  In the long months of confinement, I often thought of how to transmit the pain that a tortured person undergoes. And always I concluded that it was impossible. It is a pain without points of reference, revelatory symbols, or clues to serve as indicators.[67]

- One endeavor that seems particularly promising, and which I have attempted to pursue in this book, is that of promoting a deeper conversation about values, especially with an emphasis on the moral significance of extreme suffering. It is likely that the change in values toward greater concern for extreme suffering that could be furthered via such a conversation is among the most important changes we can make. The main reason for this, in short, is that our values are a key driver of our actions

- I will briefly address a tempting pitfall related to effective altruism, namely that of failing to invest sufficiently in oneself. For as noted in the introduction, effective altruism is not altruism in the irresponsible sense of sacrificing for others without any regard for oneself. Not only would that amount to an indefensible neglect of an individual of great inherent value, i.e. the altruist, but it is also just an ineffective and unsustainable strategy for helping others. In other words, effective altruism necessitates self-care of the highest quality
