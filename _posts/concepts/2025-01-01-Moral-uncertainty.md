title: Moral uncertainty
---

Moral uncertainty is a philosophical concept that acknowledges our limited confidence in moral theories or judgments. It recognizes that we might be uncertain about:

1. Which moral theory is correct (e.g., utilitarianism, deontology, virtue ethics)
2. How to apply moral principles in specific situations
3. How to weigh different moral considerations against each other
   This uncertainty raises important questions about how we should make decisions when we're not sure which moral framework is right or how to interpret moral principles.

## Key Approaches to Moral Uncertainty

Several philosophers have proposed ways to deal with moral uncertainty:

- **Maximize Expected Moral Value**: Similar to expected utility theory, this approach suggests weighing the rightness of actions according to different moral theories, adjusted by your confidence in each theory.
- **Moral Hedging**: Taking precautionary actions that would be acceptable across multiple moral frameworks you find plausible.
- **Moral Parliament**: Imagining representatives of different moral theories negotiating to reach a compromise decision.

## Practical Implications

Moral uncertainty has practical implications for how we approach complex ethical issues like:

- Animal welfare
- Future generations
- Global poverty
- Emerging technologies
  By acknowledging moral uncertainty, we might adopt a more humble, open-minded approach to ethical disagreements, recognizing that even our deeply held moral convictions could be mistaken.
