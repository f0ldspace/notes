## Resolve Cycles
### Page 206 @ 28 April 2025 
*The resolve cycle technique is one we offer up with a sort of shamefaced shrug, because it doesn’t sound like “real” applied rationality. It doesn’t have the rock-solid research underpinnings of TAPs or inner sim, or a carefully considered model like the ones behind turbocharging and double crux. It sometimes comes across like the worst possible advice—the sort of thing people say when they don’t actually want to help you with your problem:
“Have you tried setting a five-minute timer and just, y’know—solving it?”
But it works. Not always, not perfectly, but shockingly often and surprisingly well. And so we recommend that you suspend your disbelief (it’s justified) and put your objections on hold (we were just as incredulous as you are) and give it an actual, honest shot. In the worst case, if it does you absolutely no good, you’ve only wasted five minutes,*

*Be sure to take breaks—for many people, resolve cycles are a high-energy burn, and trying to do too many in a row or trying to do them without enough time in between could mean driving yourself very hard into a hole.*

*Over time, you may find that you develop a standard set of prompts and actions that you find useful to draw on when doing resolve cycles—your own personal grimoire of debugging exercises.*

*Research on attention and task switching has found that there is a large benefit to focusing on one task at a time. Task switching causes a large temporary drop in performance immediately after a task switch and a smaller persistent impairment as long as switching tasks is a possibility.*
