## Key Achievements

### Early Career & Hacking

- **iPhone Jailbreak (2007)**: In August 2007, seventeen-year-old George Hotz became the first person reported to remove the SIM lock on an iPhone.
- **PlayStation 3 Hack (2011)**: On January 2, 2011, Hotz posted a copy of the private key of the PlayStation 3 on his website. This led to a lawsuit from Sony, which was eventually settled out of court.
- **Towelroot (2011)**: In June 2014, Hotz published a root exploit software hack for Samsung Galaxy S5 devices used in the US market.

### Companies & Projects

#### comma.ai (2015-present)

- Since September 2015, he has been working on his vehicle automation machine learning company comma.ai.
- Developed openpilot, an open-source driver assistance system
- comma.ai open sourced their self driving car software (called openpilot) on November 30, 2016, emphasizing its intended use for research without a warranty.

#### the tiny corp (2022-present)

- Hotz founded tiny corp on November 5, 2022. tiny corp aims to port machine learning instruction sets to hardware accelerators.
- On May 24, 2023, tiny corp announced that they raised $5.1M to build computers for machine learning and develop neural network framework called tinygrad.

### tinygrad

Tinygrad, the neural network framework developed by Tiny Corp, aims to provide a balance between the simplicity of Andrej Karpathy's micrograd framework and the functionality of the PyTorch framework.

Key features:

- It compiles a custom kernel for every operation, allowing extreme shape specialization. All tensors are lazy, so it can aggressively fuse operations.
- It has 12 operations, all of which are ADD/MUL only
- tinygrad is used in openpilot to run the driving model on the Snapdragon 845 GPU

### tinybox

- We sell a computer called the tinybox. It comes in two colors. [...] It is a very powerful computer for deep learning, and likely the best performance/$
- the TinyBox, a $15,000 AI computer aimed at local model training and inference, serving as a personal compute cluster.

- UPDATE. I was banned from LinkedIn! Apparently LinkedIn isn't for everything.
- An update on hiring for tiny corp. We have had an ~80% conversion rate for bounty solvers to internship offer.

## Notable Quotes

- "We raised $5M from an amazing set of investors who are aligned with real value creation. We make money selling computers for more than they cost to make."
- "I don't want to live in a world of closed AI running in a cloud you've never seen, I want everyone to have an AI that they own, both training and infer"
