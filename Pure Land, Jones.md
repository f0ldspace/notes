- The Pure Land tradition probably offers the most egalitarian path to enlightenment, which partly accounts for its ubiquitous presence throughout the Mahayana Buddhist world

- 18. If, when I attain buddhahood, sentient beings in the lands of the ten directions who sincerely and joyfully entrust themselves to me, desire to be born in my land, and think of me even ten times should not be born there, may I not attain perfect enlightenment. Excluded, however, are those who commit the five grave offenses and abuse the Right Dharma

- For the esoteric practitioner, rapid attainment of buddhahood constituted the primary aim of practice, and this was achieved by involving the whole person in meditation. They actualized this total involvement by making sure that the practice utilized the three components of “body, speech, and mind.” Sitting in a particular posture and forming a ritual hand-gesture, or mudrā, brought in the body. Recitation of ritual formulas, called dhāraṇī or mantra, kept the voice involved. Finally, visualization of the protector deity occupied the mind. In particular, a philosophical recognition that the buddha or bodhisattva one visualized was neither the same as nor different from the practitioner led to swift awakening and buddhahood.

- Before he died, the historical buddha Śākyamuni taught that after his departure, mentally contemplating his physical body would pacify an agitated mind. Thus, from its inception, buddha-visualization (or buddhānusmṛti in Sanskrit) has been part of the medicine cabinet of Buddhist practice

- The Indic term buddhānusmṛti became nianfo, or “contemplation of a buddha,” in Chinese, and by means of an ambiguity in this term’s native meaning, nianfo came to designate the primary practice of Pure Land Buddhism.

- The word nirvana points to the state of a fire that has gone out. The Buddha often described our present world as a house on fire, and living beings as burning up with passions. To achieve the goal of Buddhist practice meant to “cool down” and put out these flames of suffering. However, later Buddhist thinkers such as the composers of a text called The Questions of King Milinda went further and compared living beings themselves to flames. Like a flame, we are not things or objects; we are self-perpetuating processes like fire

- Early Mahayana texts such as the Lotus Sūtra went out of their way to explain that buddhas do not just “blink out” of existence, nor do they abide beyond the reach of followers who need their help. Instead, they can manifest where needed to render assistance to those still suffering. Another Mahayana text, Nāgārjuna’s Root Stanzas on the Middle Way (Mulamadhyamaka-kārikā), asserted that because of this, nirvana and samsara (the realms of rebirth and suffering) were coextensive. Thus, a buddha and an ordinary person could both be in the same place, but it would manifest to the buddha as nirvana, while for the ordinary being it remains samsara. The difference is not in the place, but in the mind

- Mahayana, therefore, traded a world in which a buddha only appeared at rare intervals for one which at all times had millions of buddhas in residence. Mahayana scriptures named them in the hundreds, and a handful gained importance and eclipsed the historical buddha in the practices of some groups: Amitābha, Akṣobhya, Vairocana, and so on

- Buddhas, by definition, are beings whose attainments have entirely purified their karma. This means that their personal qualities and the environments they inhabit will both be pure. This led to the idea of “buddha-fields” or “buddha-lands,” places over which buddhas reign and which, unlike our own world (called Sahā or “Endurance”), have no impurities, moral evil, or unfavorable rebirths. They are places where the environment is as untainted as the mind and body of the buddha that presides over it

- For beginners and those with little leisure for deep practice, he taught the simple method of orally reciting the name of the buddha Amitābha, while he instructed his monastic disciples and other advanced practitioners in more arduous and complex visualization exercises. Traditional biographies say he had hundreds, if not thousands, of converts. Many are said to have committed suicide in their zeal to attain immediate rebirth in the Pure Land. Shandao himself is said in many sources to have died in this manner, but few scholars accept this account. While the number of disciples who ended their own lives may be exaggerated in the sources, religious suicide was neither unheard of nor frowned upon at that time, and better-documented instances of it are not rare

- They maintained the legitimacy of thinking that the Pure Land was a real place located to the west, a view called “western-direction Pure Land” (Ch.: xifang jingtu) in opposition to those who held that it was only the way any world appeared to a purified consciousness, a view called “mind-only Pure Land” (Ch.: weixin jingtu). Finally, they stood by the belief that the “other-power” of Amitābha brought the believer to rebirth in the Pure Land against adversaries who thought only one’s own “self-power” availed.

- The concepts of principle (Ch.: li) and phenomenon (Ch.: shi) have been part of Chinese thought from early times. Roughly speaking, “principle” points to the abstract patterns that govern the growth, development, and movement of things, and “phenomenon” denotes the individual things in which those patterns manifest

- In isolation, the search for rebirth in Sukhāvatī would indeed be escapist and otherworldly, “mind-only” would benefit no one but the person whose mind has been purified, and the search to construct a pure land in the human realm without aspirations for rebirth and mental purification would be just another form of clinging. All three forms of Pure Land have their place even within the life and practice of an individual devotee.

- Most interestingly, Pure Land symbols have become ways of publicly identifying oneself as a Buddhist. A rosary of “recitation beads” (Ch.: nianzhu) around the wrist signals one’s Buddhist identity as surely as a cross around the neck marks one as Christian. When encountering one another as Buddhists, people will replace “hello” and “goodbye” with the name of Amitābha

- The earliest record of Pure Land practice in Japan dates to the year 640, when a monk named Eon, freshly returned from thirty years in China, lectured the imperial court on the Larger Sūtra; nothing more is known of his activities. A few years later, in 658, a statue of Amitābha was installed in a temple in present-day Osaka

- The Japanese term for this interdependence is yūzū, which became part of the school’s name.
  Applied to the practice of nenbutsu, Ryōnin took this to mean that no one who engages in the practice does so in isolation or without affecting others. Thus, if I recite the Buddha’s name, it does not just affect me; all of the people around me are now relating to me as someone who practices nenbutsu, and so they cannot simply continue being what they were before I began

- Finally, at the age of forty-three Hōnen found his answer in Shandao’s commentary on the Contemplation Sūtra, which convinced him that simple oral invocation was the best and most effective practice for his troubled times. He had trained in a number of practices both contemplative and ritual, but now in 1175 he discarded all of them in favor of exclusive reliance on oral invocation of Amitābha’s name

- Shinran, in contrast, made faith the centerpiece of his entire system, and in his hands it became much more than just knowing that one was bound for the Pure Land. It became instead a deep conversion experience and the very means by which rebirth became assured.

- This new way of conceiving faith grew out of Shinran’s own religious crises. During his monastic career and for a time after his return to lay life he had tried to gain religious merit by means of the difficult practices of the Tendai school, and each time he felt defeated and doomed by his lack of ability. His great breakthrough came when he realized that religious exertion of any kind arose from a lack of trust in Amitābha’s other-power and was an attempt to gain entry into the Pure Land via self-effort.

- His greatest departure from Hōnen’s thought lay in his conviction that one’s efforts cannot even bring about the arising of faith; Amitābha himself infuses the believer with faith as a free gift

- If one truly believes that self-power accomplishes nothing, not even the initial welling up of faith, then any action or practice one undertakes in order to elicit Amitābha’s compassion or to gain rebirth becomes immediately suspect. Thus, if one adopts the position that “licensed evil,” or deliberate wrongdoing assists in the process by bringing out more of the Buddha’s compassion, then one is relying on self-power just as much as if one tried to observe all the precepts and achieve contemplative samādh

- When the historical buddha Śākyamuni passed into final nirvana, he left instructions to his monastic and lay followers regarding the direction their practice should take going forward. One practice he recommended as a way of pacifying the mind was to bring his physical form and many merits to mind, and the tradition came to call this “mindfulness of the Buddha” (Skt.: buddhānusmṛti). For some meditators, this technique evolved into a process of visualizing the Buddha in great detail, and later it was supplemented by philosophical reflections on the ontological status of the buddha-image that one visualized and the relationship of this buddha with the practitioner.

- In the early seventeenth century, the monk Ch’ongheo Hyujong articulated this scheme, and it became a formal part of the monastic education system thereafter. In practice, clerics could choose to specialize in one or the other of these and emphasize it while minimizing the other two. However, in theory the three worked together. Chanting the Buddha’s name guaranteed rebirth in the Pure Land, doctrinal study would familiarize the student with the conceptual framework within which his or her own mind was nondual with the mind and land of Amitābha, and Zen meditation would allow him or her to realize this nonduality in a direct, intuitive way.
