## Preface

- "for the peace from above and the salvation of the souls"
- "They have gone out in search of the power of the Holy Spirit precisely because they lacked it, saw it nowhere around them and even believed it to have disappeared from the face of the earth."

## His Ancestors according to the flesh and according to the spirit

- "All of this is not to imply that the women of Farasa were lacking in strength, courage, or heroism. Once, the Turks were trying to capture a group of women, among whom were relatives of the Elder. Rather than end up being debased as a member of a Turk's harem—a common fate of women captives—they chose to plunge into a river, willing to drown in order to keep their faith and their honor."

## In training for the Ascetic life

- "The Jesus Prayer—in its simplest form "Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy upon me," or in its most extended form "Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy upon me, a sinner"—is a mainstay of traditional Christian prayer. In Greece, it is sometimes referred to simply as "the prayer."
- "He tried to put into practice everything that he read in the lives of the Saints. For example, he read that when a person is afraid of a particular place, he should go there until his fear is driven away."
- "Then something Costas had said came to mind: 'I can accept that Christ is an important man,' he had told me, 'righteous and virtuous. Who was hated out of envy for His virtue and condemned by His countrymen.' I said to myself, 'Since that is how Christ was, even if He was only a man, He deserves my love, obedience, and self-sacrifice. I do not want paradise—I do not want anything. It is worth making every sacrifice for the sake of His holiness and kindness.'"
- "He did not need to convince them with words: his life and struggles were the proof of his intentions"
- "He was put to the test morally, as well: his captors locked him in a room by himself and then sent in two communist women who were nearly naked. Praying fervently to the Mother of God, he immediately felt power from on high strengthening him so that he looked upon them dispassionately as his sisters, just as Adam saw Eve in paradise. When he spoke to them with kindness, they came to their senses and left in a state of tears."

## Military Service

- "'It is better,' I thought, 'for me to die once, than for someone else to die and for my conscience to kill me for the rest of my life. How would I live, knowing that I could have saved him, and I did not?' Naturally, God really helps people who sacrifice themselves for others."

## Searching and Preparing

- "One night he did not sleep at all, but spent the whole time praying and making prostrations. In the morning, the younger monk approached him. 'Did you spend the entire night tapping your foot on the floor,' he asked, 'to impress us, to make us think you were making prostrations?' Arsenios held his tongue, but he could not figure out why the brother would have such thoughts."
