# May 2025 Monthly Summary

## Overview

May was a month of technical exploration, religious study, and personal organization. I began using Claude to create weekly summaries for accountability, developed several technical tools, and started exploring Orthodox Christianity and classical Christian texts. The month included outdoor adventures, social activities, and ended with health challenges including a severe migraine.

## Major Accomplishments

### Technical Development

- **Python Projects**: Created scripts for iPod music management (transferring songs/playlists from Plex with metadata)
- **Android Development**: Built an app for tracking poker hands in private games
- **Trading Automation**: Started testing automated Hyperliquid trading systems (API data retrieval working, execution glitched)
- **Workflow Optimization**:
  - Integrated Claude research output directly to Obsidian
  - Automated prediction logging and calibration analysis workflow
  - Integrated calendar into Obsidian
  - Started developing GitHub-friendly alternative to Obsidian publish

### Learning & Study

- **Religious Study**:
  - Started reading "The Orthodox Church" by Timothy Ware
  - Read Saint Augustine's "Confessions"
  - Began "Thirty steps to heaven"
- **Technical Learning**:
  - Python materials and tutorials
  - Zero knowledge proofs
  - Split keyboards research
- **Financial Markets**: Started investing in memecoins for performance benchmarking

### Physical Activities & Social Life

- **Outdoor Adventures**:
  - Hiking and camping trip with [person_3] at [location_1]
  - Tested new Durston Xmid tent
  - Experienced dark sky location with vivid star viewing
- **Social Events**:
  - House party with [person_4], [person_3], [person_2], [person_5], and [person_6]
  - Meaningful conversation with [person_5]
- **Exercise**: One weightlifting session (noted feeling weak and worn out)

### Home & Personal Organization

- Assembled new wardrobe
- Renovated shed (cleared and replaced flooring)
- Received Hamilton Murph watch
- Started using physical notebooks for initial studying before digitizing

## Recurring Themes

### Productivity & Time Management

- Started weekly summaries for accountability (May 14th initiative)
- Persistent self-criticism about unproductive days and time wasted on reality TV
- Recognition of need for better time management

### Health & Wellness

- Started extroceptive meditation practice late in the month
- Ended month with severe multi-day migraine

### Learning Evolution

- Shifted from passive consumption (reading/podcasts) to active creation (apps/tools)
- Transitioned from digital-first to physical notebooks for initial study notes
- Moved from technical focus to religious/philosophical exploration

## Key Insights

1. **Integration is Key**: Most successful when combining tools (Claude + Obsidian, Calendar + Obsidian)
2. **Physical Activity Impact**: Intense hiking led to prolonged fatigue, suggesting need for better recovery planning
3. **Learning Style Evolution**: Movement toward physical note-taking shows adaptation of study methods
4. **Social-Technical Balance**: Best weeks balanced technical projects with meaningful social interactions

## Areas of Growth

- Expanded technical toolkit (Python, Android development, automation)
- Began spiritual exploration through Orthodox Christianity
- Improved personal organization systems
- Started regular accountability practice through weekly summaries

## Challenges

- Persistent fatigue after physical activities
- Time management and reality TV consumption
- Health issues (ending with severe migraine)
- Technical glitches (trading API execution issues)
